# Sportsbook app

Front-end Developer Assignment

## Getting Started

I used Yeoman to generate app scaffolding so there may be some junk. 
Anyway, all you need to do is 

install npm packages

```
npm install
```

install bower packages

```
npm install
```

and then start gulp server

```
gulp serve
```
